          "description": "Calculus has been used in solving many scientific and engineering problems. For optimization problems, however, the differential calculus technique sometimes has a drawback when the objective function is step-wise, discontinuous, or multi-modal, or when decision variables are discrete rather than continuous. Thus, researchers have recently turned their interests into metaheuristic algorithms that have been inspired by natural phenomena such as evolution, animal behavior, or metallic annealing. This book especially focuses on a music-inspired metaheuristic algorithm, harmony search. Interestingly, there exists an analogy between music and optimization: each musical instrument corresponds to each decision variable; musical note corresponds to variable value; and harmony corresponds to solution vector. Just like musicians in Jazz improvisation play notes randomly or based on experiences in order to find fantastic harmony, variables in the harmony search algorithm have random values or previously-memorized good values in order to find optimal solution.",

Its two central themes are the average-case complexity of state-space search algorithms and the applications of the results notably to branch-and-bound techniques. Primarily written for researchers in computer science, the author presupposes a basic familiarity with complexity theory, and it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of random variables and recursive functions. Two successful applications are presented in depth: one is a set of state-space transformation methods which can be used to find approximate solutions quickly, and the second is forward estimation for constructing more informative evaluation functions.",

          "description": "As information becomes more ubiquitous and the demands that searchers have on search systems grow, there is a need to support search behaviors beyond simple lookup. Information seeking is the process or activity of attempting to obtain information in both human and technological contexts. Exploratory search describes an information-seeking problem context that is open-ended, persistent, and multifaceted, and information-seeking processes that are opportunistic, iterative, and multitactical. Exploratory searchers aim to solve complex problems and develop enhanced mental capacities. Exploratory search systems support this through symbiotic human-machine relationships that provide guidance in exploring unfamiliar information landscapes. Exploratory search has gained prominence in recent years. There is an increased interest from the information retrieval, information science, and human-computer interaction communities in moving beyond the traditional turn-taking interaction model supported by major Web search engines, and toward support for human intelligence amplification and information use. In this lecture, we introduce exploratory search, relate it to relevant extant research, outline the features of exploratory search systems, discuss the evaluation of these systems, and suggest some future directions for supporting exploratory search. Exploratory search is a new frontier in the search domain and is becoming increasingly important in shaping our future world.

          "description": "* Covers searches for all faculty, staff, and administrative positions * Emphasizes aligning hires to departmental and institutional goals * Describes proven practices for successful outcomes Successful academic searches, where high caliber college faculty and administrators are recruited and retained, are critical to the vitality and sustainability of every institution. In higher education many faculty and administrators are thrust into the role of academic search with little preparation other than their own experience of being interviewed. Typically search committees also have to manage the process in the context of already heavy workloads. This manual provides faculty members, department heads, chairs, deans, and members of search committees with a straightforward ten-step process, using proven strategies and systematic planning, designed to facilitate group dynamics while members seek out and identify high caliber candidates and reach consensus on the best one for the institution. This book concisely lays out everything committee members need to know, replete with real life examples from diverse institutions, sample forms, timelines, and checklists. The process begins with the composition of the committee, understanding its charge, and the responsibilities of the chair and its members. It then leads the committee through the steps of drawing up the position description using input from all stakeholders, publicizing the position, evaluating resumes, planning and conducting interviews, narrowing the pool, to the final selection and negotiation processes. Throughout, the authors attend to issues of diversity and inclusion, aligning the hire with institutional goals, and avoiding legal pitfalls. Equally importantly, they set out a framework for welcoming, acclimating, and retaining new hires to ensure the return on the institution's substantial investment of time and expense to recruit them.",

          "description": "Various structures, such as buildings, bridges, and paved roads play an important role in our lives. However, these construction projects require large expenditures. Designing infrastructure cost-efficiently while satisfying all necessary design constraints is one of the most important and difficult tasks for a structural engineer. Traditionally, mathematical gradient-based optimization techniques have been applied to these designs. However, these gradient-based methods are not suitable for discrete design variables such as factory-made cross sectional area of structural members. Recently, researchers have turned their interest to phenomenon-mimicking optimization techniques because these techniques have proved able to efficiently handle discrete design variables. One of these techniques is harmony search, an algorithm developed from musical improvisation that has been applied to various structural design problems and has demonstrated cost-savings. This book gathers all the latest developments relating to the application of the harmony search algorithm in the structural design field in order for readers to efficiently understand the full spectrum of the algorithm’s potential and to easily apply the algorithm to their own structural problems. This book contains six chapters with the following subjects: standard harmony search algorithm and its applications by Lee; standard harmony search algorithm for steel frame design by Degertekin; adaptive harmony search algorithm and its applications by Saka and Hasançebi; harmony particle swarm algorithm and its applications by Li and Liu; hybrid algorithm of harmony search, particle swarm & ant colony for structural design by Kaveh and Talatahari; and parameter calibration of viscoelastic and damage functions by Mun and Geem.",
